# Storyline:
# Fred's quest for Meowtropolis begins when he finds an ancient map of the city. He encounters some evil yarn ball gods. Please help save the ancient city before the evil gods take Fred back to where he belongs.

# Inspiration:
# We are avid cat lovers and wanted a goofy orange cat character to be our player1. We wanted to have a game similar to Temple Run and the no internet dinosaur game as well. Aislinn is # a bioengineering major and completed multiple electronics labs this semester. The elements used in the lab circuits were brought into the game. Nolan is an avid gamer and CS major 
# and wanted to push his boundaries on trying something new like coding this game.

# Setup:
# Using an Arduino Mega: 
# Pin connections: 
# accelerometor:
# Vcc-> 5V on bread board
# GND-> ground on bread board
# X-> A8 arduno
# y-> A9 arduino
# z-> A1O arduino
# button:
# white cord-> A6 arduino 
# purple cord-> gnd breadboard
# red cord-> 5V breadboard
# thermistor:
# blue cord-> gnd breadboard
# yellow cord-> A7 arduino
# red cord -> 5v breadboard 
# force sensor:
# red wire -> A11 arduino
# buzzers (2x):
# orange wire -> 14 pin purple - 15 pin arduino
# see image file on GitHub for where the wires are on breadboard, note own variations of circuit creations.
